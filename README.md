#Sentiment Analysis Using Bidirectional LSTM
Project Overview
This project demonstrates the application of a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) model for sentiment analysis on a dataset of tweets. The objective is to classify tweets into positive or negative sentiment based on their textual content.

Dataset
The dataset used is a subset of the Sentiment140 dataset, which consists of 1.6 million tweets labeled as positive or negative. For faster processing, a smaller subset was used.

Model Architecture
The model is built using TensorFlow and Keras and includes the following layers:

Embedding Layer: Converts words into dense vectors of fixed size.
Bidirectional LSTM Layers: Two layers with 64 and 32 units respectively, to capture context from both directions.
Dropout Layers: Used for regularization to prevent overfitting.
Dense Layer: Final layer with a sigmoid activation function for binary classification.
Data Preprocessing
The data preprocessing steps include:

Cleaning the Tweets: Removing URLs, special characters, and unnecessary spaces.
Tokenization: Converting text into sequences of integers.
Padding: Ensuring all sequences have the same length by padding shorter sequences with zeros.
Training the Model
The model is trained for 5 epochs using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss function. The training process is monitored with accuracy as the primary metric.

Evaluation
The model is evaluated on a test set, and its performance is measured using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report.

Visualizations
Various visualizations are included to better understand the data and model performance:

Word Clouds: Visual representation of the most frequent words in positive and negative tweets.
Accuracy and Loss Plots: Visualizations of the training and validation accuracy and loss over epochs.
Installation
To run this project locally:

Clone the repository: git clone <repository-link>
Install the required dependencies: pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Once the environment is set up, you can train the model and evaluate it by running the provided Python scripts.

Results
The final model achieved an accuracy of approximately [insert accuracy]% on the test set. The confusion matrix and classification report provide further insights into the model's performance.

Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates the effectiveness of BiLSTM for sentiment analysis. The model is able to classify sentiments in tweets with reasonable accuracy.

Future Work
Potential improvements could include:

Using a more complex model or pre-trained transformers like BERT.
Expanding the dataset to improve model generalization.
Fine-tuning hyperparameters for better performance.
